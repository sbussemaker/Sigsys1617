Answer here the posed question:
  In order to obtain reliable answers, you need a high samplerate.
  This is needed to make an accurate transform from x[n] to x(t), since t = n/fs.
  The required height of the samplerate is dependant on the frequency of the input signal.
  An higher f needs an higher fs. 

  Phi is determined on basis of the first peak. 
  This means that when the point where the first peak is encountered, is closer to the actual
  point where the first peak is, the accuracy goes up. This means that the samplerate and the
  accuracy are correlated. The reason that we need a high samplerate is because of the way we 
  determine phi, namely by use of the first peak. If we are a little bit off we are quite a bit off.
  Therefore we need a high samplerate.
